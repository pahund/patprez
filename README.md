## What Is It About?

_Wednesday, 28 October 2015, [mobilesuite Berlin](http://www2.mobilesuite.de/)_

At the 29th #ebaytechtalk, we’ll talk about lessons learned from relaunching mobile.de’s home page (10M visitors per month) – 100% JavaScript replacing a Java webapp.

As always we will have some free food and drinks afterwards.

## About the Speaker

Patrick Hund, software engineer, full stack developer and JavaScript aficionado. 

He and his team created a Node.js web app from scratch within 9 weeks. They used the latest and greatest incarnation of JavaScript – ECMAScript 2015, a.k.a. ES6 – for the backend and frontend alike. They spent late nights coding in gleeful frenzy, stepped into pitfalls, moaned about WTFs, scaled the dizzy heights of asynchronicity. This is this is their story.
